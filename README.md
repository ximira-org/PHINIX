PHINIX (Perceptive Helper with Intelligent Navigation and Intuitive eXperience)
is a wearable system that helps people who are visually impaired or blind in
perceiving their surroundings. PHINIX uses AI cameras to visualize the environment
in three dimensions, analyze the scene using Artificial Intelligence (AI), and
communicate with the user using audio and/or haptic feedback. To learn more about
PHINIX, please visit [Ximira's Product page](https://ximira.org/product).

PHINIX is developed by Ximira, a not-for-profit organization with a mission to
develop an innovative, wearable system that gives blind users more freedom to
participate in all aspects of society. To learn more about our story, please
